# Movie-Recommendation-System

Ever felt that moment where you watch a movie that you cannot get out of your head and you want to watch more similar movies?
Look no further as our movie recommendation system does just that. The user simply inputs their movie name into our function and our system shows a comprehensive list of similar movies.

Our system has been built on Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda 3) using a co-similarity factoring system similar to that used in Netflix and Amazon Prime. The crux of our system is rating system whose formula has been designed solely by our group members which we believe is the perfect match for a user input movie.

The only dependency is that, a system wanting to use our code must have Jupyter Notebook where this code can be run.
